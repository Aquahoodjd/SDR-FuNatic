# SDR-FuNatic
Software-Defined Radio (SDR) HW &amp; SW platforms, testbeds, references, Open Source working groups, standards, Cognitive Radio (CR), SW Defined Wireless Networks (SDWN), Cognitive Spectrum Access (CSA), 3G, 4G, LTE, 5G, Space Communications, etc

You can find more than 100 repositories with code, information and documentation related to SDR and Digital Comms, most of them are forked, so credits are for authors and contributors.

To refresh concepts on Digital Communications and SDR techniques has been included a selection of free available books in [SDR Publications and Books](https://github.com/BelmY/wikiSDoR/wiki/SDR-Books-&-Publications) based on first [SDR Books Gist](https://gist.github.com/BelmY/92313e3471f95e6d3178bf47ae2e6792)

Just enjoy with fun all the contents and information in [SDR4Funatics](https://github.com/BelmY/SDR-FuNatic) and multiband SDR's in [SDR4Fun](http://sdr4fun.com/)

We are also preparing a Linux distribution, named ["DragonSDoR"](https://github.com/BelmY/wikiSDoR/wiki), with essential SDR, Decoding, Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) & Processing (inc. GNU Octave) frameworks and applications for SDR experimentation, based on the excellent DragonOS compilation and Lubuntu. If you want to contribute to this version, feel free to propose your preferences and skills.

[DragonOS Focal](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonos-focal/) is an out-of-the-box Lubuntu 20.04 based x86_64 operating system for anyone interested in software defined radios.

Additional applications and SDR devices support have been added to the original DragonOS
